Support vector machines (SVMs) are an alternative machine learning model that we discussed in class.
We have provided you an SVM implementation (using a radial basis function (RBF) kernel) within |src-spam/svm.py| (You should not need to modify that code).

One important part of training an SVM parameterized by an RBF kernel (a.k.a Gaussian kernel) is choosing an appropriate kernel radius parameter.

Complete the |compute_best_svm_radius()| by writing code to compute the best SVM radius which maximizes accuracy on the validation dataset.
